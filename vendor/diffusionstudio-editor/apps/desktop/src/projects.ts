const readme = (displayName: string): string => `# ${displayName}

A Diffusion Studio project: a video composition authored as code. The folder is
a plain npm package whose entry file is a [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
component; the app compiles it and renders every element into an editable node
on the canvas.

## Agents

Everything an agent needs is in the app's MCP server (\`diffusion\`): its tools
are the API, its instructions say how to work, and its resources are the
authoring reference for the installed version. If it is not among your tools,
add it — the app serves it at \`${MCP_URL}\` while it is running — and start
a new session.

## Structure

| Path | What it is |
| ---- | ---------- |
| \`index.tsx\` | The entry. Its default export renders the composition. |
| \`package.json\` | The project record: \`projectId\` (its identity, kept across renames), \`displayName\` (the name shown in the app), \`main\` (the entry), \`diffusion\` (how each scene is exported), and the diffusion commands as scripts. |
| \`tsconfig.json\` | Types for the composition tags, through \`jsxImportSource\`. |
| \`assets.yml\` | The asset library: for every asset its library path, where its bytes are, and what it was found to be; for a generation without bytes, where it stands. Written by the app; hand edits are read on the next load. |
| \`assets/\` | The library's files: put one here and it is taken in while the app watches, and the app writes its own here too — generations under \`assets/generated/\`. Media imported through the app is linked where it lies instead, never copied. |
| \`cache/\` | Derived data (thumbnails, waveforms). Disposable, and not checked in. |

## Authoring

The source is the document, in both directions. Saving recompiles the project
and remounts it — scenes rebuild in place, the way reloading a page does, and a
compile error leaves the last good render on the canvas. Edits made in the app
come back the other way: a dragged rect, a trimmed clip or a retyped line lands
as a prop on the element it was authored as.

\`\`\`tsx
export default function Project() {
  return (
    <stage background="#161616" camera={[0.3, 0, 0, 0.3, 85, 150]}>
      <scene name="Intro" width={1920} height={1080} fill="black" active>
        <video src="b-roll/drone.mp4" start={0} end={6} width={1920} height={1080} />
        <text y={860} width={1920} textAlign="center" fontFamily="Inter" fontSize={96} start={1} end={5}>
          Hello
          <animation type="fade" duration={0.5} />
          <animation type="fade" phase="out" duration={0.5} />
        </text>
      </scene>
    </stage>
  )
}
\`\`\`

- \`<stage>\` is the root, and holds one \`<scene>\` per frame you cut in. A scene
  owns the timeline its children sit on; nothing outside a scene has a clock to
  be placed against.
- One scene carries \`active\` — the one the playhead, the timeline and an export
  are pointed at — and the stage carries the \`camera\` the canvas opens on, a
  \`[scale, 0, 0, scale, x, y]\` matrix (\`0.3\` fits a 1920×1080 frame). Both are
  editor state: the app writes them back as the view is panned or a scene is
  clicked, but a project that ships without them opens on an empty timeline,
  looking at the corner of nothing.
- Position and size are explicit, in pixels. There is no layout pass and no CSS.
- \`start\` / \`end\` place a clip on that timeline, \`sourceIn\` / \`sourceOut\` choose
  the part of the media that plays. Times are seconds (\`1.5\`), frames (\`45f\`) or
  \`"MM:SS"\`.
- Style and motion are children: \`<animation>\` for a preset in or out,
  \`<keyframeTrack>\` with \`<keyframe>\` children for one property, \`<solidPaint>\`
  and the gradient paints, \`<stroke>\`, \`<shadow>\`, \`<effect>\`.
- \`src\` takes a library path (\`"b-roll/drone.mp4"\` — the portable form, it
  survives the file being relinked), an asset id, a URL, or an absolute path.
- Generated assets are declared rather than fetched: \`src={generate.image({ prompt })}\`,
  and \`generate.video\`, \`generate.voice\`, \`generate.audio\`. They are produced on
  mount, in dependency order. \`diffusion context\` reports where each stands:
  generating, failed with the reason, or done with the asset path it landed as.
- Solid is fully available while mounting: \`<For>\`, \`<Show>\`, \`createMemo\`, and
  \`useTicker()\` for values that follow the playhead.
- npm packages work as they normally do. The folder is a real npm package, so
  \`npm i three\` in it is all it takes: anything in \`node_modules\` is resolved
  and bundled, subpath imports included. A composition runs in a browser
  context, so a package that needs Node APIs will not bundle.

Types are stripped at compile time and never checked, so typecheck the project
yourself with \`npx tsc --noEmit\`.

## Commands

Every diffusion command is a script here: \`npm run\` lists them, and
\`npm run <name> -- <args>\` runs one (\`npm run grab -- b-roll/drone.mp4 -c 6\`).
All of them talk to the running app, except \`fonts\`.

| Script | Command | What it does |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| \`open\` | \`diffusion open .\` | Launch the app with this project open. |
| \`context\` | \`diffusion context\` | Which project the app has open, where its playhead sits, its fonts, where its generations stand. |
| \`capture\` | \`diffusion capture <id>\` | Render frames of a scene, as an export would, to labelled PNG contact sheets. |
| \`probe\` | \`diffusion media probe <id\\|path>\` | Container and per-track metadata, without decoding. |
| \`transcribe\` | \`diffusion media transcribe <id\\|path>\` | Timed speech transcript, word by word. |
| \`grab\` | \`diffusion media grab <id\\|path>\` | Decode frames of a video to labelled PNG contact sheets. |
| \`filmstrip\` | \`diffusion media filmstrip <id\\|path>\` | Thumbnail grid across a window of a video. |
| \`waveform\` | \`diffusion media waveform <id\\|path>\` | Loudness over time, with the silences marked. |
| \`listen\` | \`diffusion media listen <id\\|path>\` | Ask a multimodal model what is in an audio track. |
| \`models\` | \`diffusion models [type]\` | Generation models and their per-model constraints. |
| \`voices\` | \`diffusion voices\` | Speech voices for \`generate.voice\`. |
| \`fonts\` | \`diffusion fonts\` | Local font families, valid as \`fontFamily\`. |
| \`logs\` | \`diffusion logs\` | Recent console output from the app. |
| \`screenshot\` | \`diffusion screenshot\` | The whole app window as a PNG. |
| \`report\` | \`diffusion report <title>\` | File a bug against the editor, with diagnostics attached. |
